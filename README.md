# SmartFlora
Designed the SmartFlora system as a hardware solution for plant lovers who lack the knowledge and time to maintain proper plant growth conditions. The device reads information from the plant's environment with sensors and uses an ESP32 microcontroller to provide users with online access to data about the plant's growth, as well as WhatsApp notifications for necessary changes. The device also incorporates Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, and is housed in a wooden case for a natural look. This unique device offers a simple, effective, and connected solution for plant care, leveraging microcontrollers, sensors, and wireless technologies.
