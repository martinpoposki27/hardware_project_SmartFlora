# SmartFlora
Designed the SmartFlora system as a hardware solution for plant lovers who lack the knowledge and time to maintain proper plant growth conditions. The device reads information from the plant's environment with sensors and uses an ESP32 microcontroller to provide users with online access to data about the plant's growth, as well as WhatsApp notifications for necessary changes. The device also incorporates Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, and is housed in a wooden case for a natural look. This unique device offers a simple, effective, and connected solution for plant care, leveraging microcontrollers, sensors, and wireless technologies.
Through my experience working on the SmartFlora project, I have gained proficiency in programming microcontrollers, specifically the ESP32, using the Arduino IDE. I have also developed skills in using ready-made libraries to connect multiple components and simplify the development process while reducing errors. In particular, I have experience using libraries such as DHTesp.h, WiFiManager.h, WiFi.h, AsyncTCP.h, and Blynk.h to measure environmental conditions, connect to WiFi networks, and provide remote monitoring and control capabilities.
